  <h2>To-day</h2>

  <p>Build the tabs, experiment with push-to-detail page (pop to return), exercise the Storage engine. Perhaps see about making typical database actions available thru a service/provider.</p>
  <p>Mock the Camera by generating fake data and placing some kind of image in the cache.
  </p>
  <p>Multi-capture, in particular, can be mocked for any number of snapshots.</p>
  <p>Storage accepts JSON. So... wouldn't that make the export dirt-simple? </p>
  <p>Supposedly there can be multiple Stores; at least LocalForage allows for that. Would that help or is that no longer necessary?</p>
